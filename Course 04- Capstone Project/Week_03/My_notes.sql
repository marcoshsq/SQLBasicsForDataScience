Dive Deeper: 

Look deeper into the features you are investigating, consider:

- Relationships / Correlation, Pearson Correlation; 
- Linear Regression for future prediction (if the relationship is linear);
- Textual Analysis for TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency; Row-based and column-based, stop-word removal?.
- Specify 1-2 correlations you discovered;
- List the fields that you found to be correlated and describe what you learned from these correlations.

Go Broader:
                               
- Expand the features you are investigating. Look for connections/relationships that you may have initially missed;
- What jumps out at you now?.
- Use the descriptive stats to point you to features that you may now want to consider;
- What key terms did you discover in any text analysis, for whom? 
- Any themes? If you are not analyzing text, summarize what other things you are considering in your analysis?
